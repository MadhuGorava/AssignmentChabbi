In this project, let's build a **Typing Test** by applying the concepts we have learned till now.

# Touch Typing Web Application

This is a web-based application built in ReactJS for touch typing practice. It allows users to practice typing the 8 keys of the keyboard (asdfjkl;) without looking at the keyboard.

## Features

- Visual guidance: The application visually displays the next key to be typed.
- Key count: The application measures the number of keys pressed during a 5-minute practice session.
- Accuracy percentage: The application calculates and displays the accuracy percentage of the typed keys.

## Installation
